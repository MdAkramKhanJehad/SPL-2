# Software Project Lab-2: Agri-Pro

<b>Agri-pro</b> is an android application, which is very helpful for agricultural students and farmers. This is intended to ease the students in increasing their vocabulary , farmers to seek help from a question-answer forum, get live weather forecasts, get fertilizer calculation, get disease information of some fruits and vegetables  with more convenience. <br><br>
Me and my teammate @Ashrafulgafurtantan prepared <b>Software Requirements Specification(named SRS_of_Agri-Pro.pdf)</b> first and then developed the project accordingly.
